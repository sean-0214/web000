- **Risk Profile**: Medium volatility, systematic risk exposure

### Strategy 3: Volume-Price Momentum Alpha
**Approach**: Capturing short-term momentum using volume-weighted indicators
- **Data Sources**: Intraday trading volume, price movements, market microstructure
- **Methodology**: Signal processing techniques for pattern recognition
- **Performance**: Delivered 22% annual returns with high turnover
- **Risk Profile**: Higher volatility, market timing dependent
